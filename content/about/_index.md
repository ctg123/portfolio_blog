Greetings ladies and gentlemen! üëãüèæ

My name is **Chaance Graves**. Welcome to my website where I share my projects that I've worked on or still tinkering with. I'm a creative problem solver eager to implement solutions to a wide range of problems foreseen in our modern society.

![This is me](/img/blog-photos/about_me.jpg)

I currently work at [Intel Corporation](https://jobs.intel.com/page/show/data-center-careers-US) based at their Santa Clara campus in Silicon Valley, California as a Datacenter Platform Applications Engineer since July 2017.

I provide technical support and expertise for Intel server CPU's and server board design development for customers such as [Facebook](https://code.fb.com/category/data-center-engineering/), [Google](https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/), [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/data-center/data-centers/), etc. My primary OEM customer designs cloud computing server systems for companies such as Verizon Media (formerly Yahoo!), Apple, Dropbox,  and Amazon Web Services (AWS).

My journey so far has me serving customers and fellow colleagues within the tech industry from different geographic regions on a global scale including U.S., Mexico, China, Taiwan, and Japan. I've also served as an Intel recruiting representative for the Datacenter Group for my Alma mater Texas A&M University, Prairie View, and at [NSBE](https://nsbe.org/home.aspx) annual conventions.

I mentor high school students from underrepresented communities in Oakland, CA to teach and inspire them to pursue careers in STEM. I always strive to be an advocate and give back to others who aspire to follow a path like mine.
