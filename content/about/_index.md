Greetings ladies and gentlemen! üëãüèæ

My name is **Chaance Graves**. Welcome to my website where I share my projects that I've worked on or still tinkering with. I'm a creative problem solver implementing solutions to a wide range of problems foreseen in our modern society. 

![This is me](/img/blog-photos/about_me.jpg)

I currently work at [Intel Corporation](https://jobs.intel.com/page/show/data-center-careers-asia) based at their Santa Clara campus in Silicon Valley, California as a Datacenter Platform Applications Engineer since July 2017.

I provide technical support and expertise for Intel server CPU's and server board design development for customers such as [Facebook](https://code.fb.com/category/data-center-engineering/), [Google](https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/), [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/data-center/data-centers/), etc. My primary OEM customer designs cloud computing server systems for companies such as Verizon Media (formerly Yahoo!), Apple, Dropbox, Amazon Web Services (AWS).

My journey so far has me serving customers and fellow colleagues within the tech industry from different geographic regions around the U.S., Mexico, China, Taiwan, and Japan. I've also served as an Intel recruiting representative for the Datacenter Group for my Alma mater Texas A&M University, Prairie View, and at NSBE annual conventions.

I mentor high school students from underrepresented communities in Oakland, CA to teach and inspire them to pursue careers in STEM. As of recent, I joined Microsoft Philanthropies' [TEALS](https://www.tealsk12.org/) (Technology Education and Literacy in Schools) program to share my knowledge and insight to help build sustainable Computer Science education for high schools.
