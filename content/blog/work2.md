Are you new to programming? have questions about which language would be a good start?

This is actually more a personal preference depending on what the project and solution you're looking to achieve. However, for a beginner you have lots of flexibility to experiment which one is right for you. One programming language I enjoy working with and others have found useful is Python. I recommend to start with [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) as it has more community support to be developed and used for years to come.

There are likely millions of developers around the world are using Python to build projects, tools and teaching others the fundamentals of programming. You can do all kinds of other amazing work in a multitude of domains.

##### Example applications:

\-  Web applications

\-  report generation

\-  test automation

\-  Machine learning/ Deep learning

\-  Ethical Hacking

\- Scientific applications, High performance computing

\- etc....

#### Helpful online resources & books

There are plentiful resources you can find online to teach yourself Python or  pair with a small group to work on projects!

*  [Codeacademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3): Codecademy offers free code tutorials are very popular for good reason. The tutorials should give a good idea of what it's like to code Python with hands-on lessons where you actually get to write some code....
* [Learn Python the Hard Way by Zed Shaw](https://learncodethehardway.org/python/): This book is well received and aims to teach beginners how to read and write basic Python to then understand other books on Python. It is high quality which I recommend to start. You can try the [free sample](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/python3/) to see if it would work for you.
* [Real Python](https://realpython.com/): This website offers tutorials to learn any aspect of Python you curious about learning about.
* [Automate the boring stuff with Python by Al Sweigart](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/): This is enjoyable read and practical for anyone who has or currently working a tedious, routine job! He also offers a video course provided through Udemy.

Hopefully this has helped with your programming journey. Feel free to discuss any other useful resources or projects you've discovered learning Python. üëåüèæ
