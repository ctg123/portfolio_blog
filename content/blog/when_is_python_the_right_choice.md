Are you new to programming? have questions about which language would be a good to start with?

This is actually more a personal preference depending on what the project and solution you're looking to achieve. However, for a beginner, you have lots of flexibility to experiment which one is right for you. One programming language I enjoy working with and others have found useful is Python. I recommend to start with [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) as it has more community support to be developed and used for years to come.

There are likely millions of developers around the world using Python to build projects, tools, and using it to teach others the fundamentals of programming. You can do all kinds of other amazing work in a multitude of domains.

#### Example applications:

* Web applications 
* Machine Learning / Deep learning
* Automating weekly emails
* Setting up jobs to update a spreadsheet
* etc....

#### Helpful online resources & books

There are plentiful resources you can find online to teach yourself Python or  pair with a small group to work on projects!
