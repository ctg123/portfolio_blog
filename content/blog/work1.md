Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean.

> The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text didn't listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and made herself on the way.

Below is the basic principles I've described to help reinforce the practical skills to leverage both the STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, Math). I always reflect on these ideas to see where any impact can be made towards economic empowerment, environmental sustainability, and equity.

How can I get STEAMEEE and fired up ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥?

**S (Science)** - Science is the knowledge domain to asking and understanding how our world works, and what areas spark our interest. Examples include physical and life sciences, computer science, and interdisciplinary case studies.

**T (Technology)** - Understanding how technology can be leveraged as a powerful medium to develop and collaborate among the communities to truly build something worthwhile and beneficial to society and the our environment. (Examples: semiconductor tech, material science, cloud based services, artificial intelligence, etcâ€¦)

**E (Engineering)** - The practical arm to build and put ideas into reality within creative designs that can exist among in the either the physical or digital world. These products and services allow the champions to have their inventions patent protected.

**A (Arts)** - We as humans have immense creative potential and can express ourselves with beautiful pieces of art through many mediums (paintings, fashion, drawings, creative writing, music, etc.)

**M (Mathematics)** - The skill we use as a foundation for all the other areas to exist. It can be as simple or as complex as you choose depending on what the situation and problems calls for. It is the most universal language that anyone can understand. It is not about marks, it is an essential life skill that will apply to anything we do in our daily lives.

EEâ€¦

**Economic empowerment/Entrepreneurship** - Learn how to use all the knowledge accessible to build wealth and turn your passions into a business if you want, entrepreneurship, investing to actualize financial freedom for generations. Consistently apply the fail fast methodology to increase everyone's profit margins over time while building perseverance, patience and focus on their goals. As adults, according to Dale Carnegie's observations (author of **_How to Win Friends and Influence People)_** is that we consistently seek out learning how to master these areas, often when it needs critical attention:

* manage finances
* obtain wealth
* health and wellness
* skills with people

It is becoming more imperative these lessons be taught at an early age, the earlier, the better. (85% of financial success comes from people skills, 15% technical skills \~ _Dale Carnegie_)

**Equity** - The reality of the state of the world is that it is not fair among opportunities and access to common valuable resources. We strive to make every action count towards shaping the world to become a fair playing field. Who knows where greatness can emerge? We need to be honest about how the past influenced our current state of affairs.
