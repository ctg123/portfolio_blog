Hey Folks!

In this blog post, I've gather some preliminary notes around the ever broad topic of what STEAM is all about. I'm sure you may be aware that this includes a massive area of career fields and activities, so lets look at a more specific approach that would be good to inform a beginner. 

The famous NASA physicist & mathematician, Katherine Johnson, provided a great summarizing quote:

> We will always have STEM with us. Some things will drop out of the public eye and will go away, but there will always be science, engineering, and technology. And there will always, always be mathematics.  
> \- _Katherine Johnson_

#### The S.T.E.A.M.EE principles

We can breakdown the basic principles from the acronym to help reinforce the practical skills to leverage STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, Math) principles. I always reflect on these ideas to see where any impact can be made towards economic empowerment, environmental sustainability, and equity.

How can I get STEAMEEE and fired up ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥?

**S (Science)** - Science is the knowledge domain that encourages asking and seeking to understand how our world works, and what areas spark our interest. Some examples include physical and life sciences, computer science, and interdisciplinary case studies.

**T (Technology)** - Understanding how technology can be leveraged as a powerful medium to develop and collaborate among the communities to truly build something worthwhile and beneficial to society and the our environment. (Examples: semiconductor tech, material science, cloud based services, Artificial Intelligence, etcâ€¦)

**E (Engineering)** - The practical arm to build and put ideas into reality within creative designs that can co-exist in the either the physical or digital world. These products and services would help innovators learn to own their inventions and look for their Intellectual Property to patent protected. Additionally, a healthy understanding of users feedback would always fuel engineers to provide better, more meaningful solutions as needs and demand change over time. 

**A (Arts)** - We as humans have immense creative potential and can express ourselves with beautiful pieces of art through many mediums (paintings, fashion, drawings, creative writing, music, etc.)

**M (Mathematics)** - The skill we use as a foundation for all the other areas to exist. It can be as simple or as complex as you choose depending on what the situation and problems calls for. It is the most universal language that anyone can understand. It is not about marks, it is an essential life skill that will apply to anything we do in our daily lives.

EEâ€¦

**Economic empowerment/Entrepreneurship** - Learn how to use all the knowledge accessible to build wealth and turn your passions into a business if you want, entrepreneurship, investing to actualize financial freedom for generations. We can consistently apply a "fail fast methodology" to increase everyone's profit margins over time while building perseverance, patience and focus on their goals. As adults, according to Dale Carnegie's observations (author of **_How to Win Friends and Influence People)_** is that we consistently seek out learning how to master these areas, often when it needs critical attention:

* manage finances
* obtain wealth
* health and wellness
* skills with people

It is becoming more imperative these lessons be taught at an early age, the earlier, the better. (85% of financial success comes from people skills, 15% technical skills \~ _Dale Carnegie_)

**Equity** - The reality of the state of the world is that it is not fair among opportunities and access to common valuable resources. We strive to make every action count towards shaping the world to become a fair playing field. Who knows where greatness can emerge? We need to be honest about how the past influenced our current state of affairs.

This is barely touching on what can be said about this topic. Feel free to share any thoughts, or things I've missed or may have been unclear.

All the best!
